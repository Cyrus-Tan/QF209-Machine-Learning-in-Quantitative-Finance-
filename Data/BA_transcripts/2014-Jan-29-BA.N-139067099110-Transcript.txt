Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day and welcome to the Boeing Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2013 earnings conference call.
Today's call is being recorded.
The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter 2013 earnings call.
I'm Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we've provided detailed financial information in today's press release. And you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our website at Boeing.com.

In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Troy, and good morning.
Let me begin today with some comments on our strong operating performance and strategic progress in 2013 followed by an overview of the business environment we see moving into 2014. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.
Now let's move to slide 2. Strong fourth quarter results across our Company capped a year of outstanding core operating performance and significant business achievement for our team. We successfully delivered on our strategies to convert our record backlog into profitable growth, executed well on commercial and defense development programs, and drove productivity and affordability gains throughout our business and enterprise functions.
For the full year, we reported record revenue and earnings, improved operating margins, increased cash flow, a large portion of which was returned to shareholders, and we reached our highest product backlog ever, now totaling $441 billion on net orders of $135 billion. We also continued to retire legacy business risks, including settling the long-standing A-12 litigation with the US government that dated back to 1991.
Our Commercial Airplanes business reported record revenue of $53 billion for the year on an industry record 648 total deliveries, including the highest ever deliveries for the 737, 777 and 787 programs. We successfully executed our planned production rate increases and expanded our market share leadership and deliveries that we regained in 2012.
In a strong year for orders across the industry we captured record gross orders of 1,531 airplanes and net orders of 1,355 airplanes, which increased our backlog to 5,080 Jets worth a record $374 billion. Commercial Airplanes also achieved key development milestones in 2013, including firm configuration of the 737 MAX-8 and the start of flight testing of the 787-9. And we solidified our long-term market leadership in the high-value twin aisle segment, with record orders and commitments and launching both the 787-10 and 777X.
On the other side of our business, despite continued domestic budget headwinds and tough global competition, Boeing Defense, Space & Security also had a very strong year, with revenue of $33 billion on increased deliveries of aircraft and satellites, higher operating margins, significant program wins and clear progress and further improving productivity and increasing our competitive position.
Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included a $750 million order from the US Air Force for engineering services on the B1 bomber fleet, a multi-year service support contract for the B-22, and an option exercise by Inmarsat for a fourth satellite. Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included fuselage and wing join on the first KC-46 tanker, the P-8A achieving initial operating capability within 10 days, by the way, of a target established more than 10 years ago, and successfully launching the first Inmarsat-5 satellite.
Strong operational performance throughout the year, driven by our relentless focus on business execution and competitiveness, increasing cash flow and our confidence in the future, all supported the new $10 billion share repurchase authorization and 50% increase in the dividend we announced in December. In summary, 2013 was truly a milestone year for Boeing, thanks to the tremendous effort of our employees, our partners and our customers all around the world.
With record revenue and earnings, substantial cash generation, and progress on our path to continued growth and profitability through production rate increases, execution on development programs, increased productivity and further growth in our record backlog, we strengthened our market position and our outlook for the future.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. Global customer demand for our fuel-efficient and value-creating commercial airplane family remains high, As evidenced by the 508 net orders booked during the fourth quarter and 30 added so far this month. Global passenger traffic trends are strong. Air cargo traffic is gradually improving and appears more stable than we have seen over the past year.
Recent 747-8 freighter orders from Cathay Pacific Airways and Silk Way Airlines highlight the airplane's superior value proposition and potential as market conditions improve in the cargo area. Replacement of older airplanes in favor of new models that offer compelling operating economics and increased fuel efficiency continues at a healthy pace.
Many airline customers around the world also are expanding their fleets to support the ongoing growth in passenger traffic. Deferral requests from customers are still running well below the historical average while requests to accelerate deliveries continue at a steady and quite frankly, encouraging rate. Overall, commercial aviation remains a very attractive near- and long-term growth market, and our product strategy advantage continues to position us for significant and sustained growth.
The launch of the 777X at the Dubai Air Show was the largest launch by dollar value in commercial jetliner history, with commitments and firm orders totaling 259 for this game-changing, fuel-efficient family of airplanes. The airplane's all new composite wing, flight deck and flight controls leverage technologies developed on the 787 and provide customers with unprecedented operating economics.
We are pleased that our employees, who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers 751 voted to extend their contract from 2016 through 2024. This solidifies production for the 777X in the Puget Sound region within our broadened and geographic production and engineering footprint.
In an environment where customer expectations for quality, reliability and affordability have never been higher, contract extension ensures 10 years of business continuity and further improves our productivity and competitiveness, while still also providing our workforce highly competitive wages and benefits. With a firm backlog for our current 777 family of more than 300 airplanes, coupled with strong customer demand and airplane availability this decade, we have high confidence in the successful transition to the 777X. 777 is an outstanding performer and a valuable asset. Based on buying patterns among wide-body customers, we expect the production bridge to be filled over the next few years.
The 787 production system is now operating at the 10-per-month rate in final assembly, including both the -8 and -9, which entered production last year. Flight testing of the -9 is progressing well, with first delivery on track for midyear. The in-service 787 fleet, which now totals 115 airplanes, making more than 200 flights per day, continues to set new records for fuel efficiency and passenger satisfaction.
While there is still more customer by customer variation than we would like, we have made good progress improving dispatch reliability, which is now up around 98% on average. More work to do on that one but we are moving closer to the goal line.
In the Single-Aisle segment, airline interest in our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high, with nearly 1,800 cumulative orders to date. Robust customer demand for the 737 family led us to the plan rate increase to 42 per month in 2014 and the announcement of an additional production rate increased to 47 a month in 2017. Recently, Air Canada recognized the value of the 737 MAX by committing to 61 airplanes and becoming a new Boeing narrow-body customer.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we are pleased that a FY14 budget agreement has been signed and FY15 deliberations have progressed, providing some near-term sequestration relief for the Department of Defense and our other US government customers. This averts another disruptive government shutdown and provides our customers at least a near-term planning horizon. That said, we remain very concerned about longer-term budget uncertainty, the ultimate consequences of sequestration on national security, and the potential devastating impact to the nation's industrial base.
FY14 budget strongly funds core Boeing production programs like P-8, F/A-18, Rotorcraft and satellites, as well as key development programs like the KC-46, long-range strike, and the Space Watch System. It also provides advanced procurement funds in support of continued production of the F/A-18 line into 2015. Support for critical Boeing National Security Programs continues to be driven by strong, on-cost, on-schedule performance that customers expect to meet their needs in a more-for-less world. Our Defense, Space & Security portfolio, a reliable, proven, and affordable systems and services, remains a competitive advantage in today's budget environment.
We also continue to target organic growth through investments in technology and innovation in areas such as: commercial derivatives; space unmanned systems; intelligence, surveillance & reconnaissance; cyber security; and a few, but critical, future, long, large-scale programs identified as priorities by our customers, like long-range strike, Uclass, and the T-X Trainer. Combined with our market-based affordability initiative, these investments strengthen our long-term position and differentiate us from our competitors, many of whom have scaled back R&D in these more austere times. And we continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global advantage and our efforts to mitigate domestic market pressures.
International Defense, Space & Security business represented more than 30% of BDS revenues during the quarter and remains just under 40% of the BDS backlog. We also continue to strengthen our competitive position in all markets by driving further efficiency, quality and productivity through our own offices and factories and through our Partnering for Success initiative launched last year.
We are seeing tangible benefits of our Partnering for Success work with suppliers recognizing the growth opportunity that's available to those who fully embrace its objectives. These productivity efforts, along with an enterprise-wide focus on reducing the spiraling costs of development programs, remains top priorities for improving our program profitability and enabling investment in future growth.
One final note before I hand it off to Greg, in December, we announced the series of personnel moves to strengthen our overall leadership structure as we scale up for future growth and competitiveness. We've promoted Ray Conner and Dennis Muilenburg to Boeing Vice Chairman, and named Dennis, Boeing President and Chief Operating Officer. We also appointed Chris Chadwick, President and CEO of Defense, Space & Security, replacing Dennis and named Shelley Lavender, President of Boeing Military Aircraft, replacing Chris.
Assuming some duties of -- while assuming some corporate duties as Vice Chairman, Ray's primary focus will remain on delivering the growth and profitability at Commercial Airplanes. Dennis has joined us in Chicago where he's working with me in the day-to-day oversight of the Company's business operations, with a particular focus on growth enablers, including our global relationships and development program performance.
All four are highly capable, high-performing leaders, with demonstrated track records who will continue to strengthen our Company and drive business results. And just to be clear, I'm not planning to retire anytime soon. So while you may be seeing more of them, it doesn't mean you'll be seeing less of me.
Now, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Jim and good morning.
Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our full-year results. Revenue for the year was a record $87 billion, reflecting 6% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries across our Commercial and Defense businesses. Core earnings per share was $7.07 for the full year, representing a 20% increase. The increase in EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the Company.
Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.7 billion before the $1.5 billion discretionary pension contribution. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures, both of which will ultimately factor into 2014 expected cash generation.
Moving now to our quarterly results on slide 5, fourth quarter revenue increased 7% to $23.8 billion driven by, again, strong Commercial Airplane and Defense deliveries. Core operating margin in the quarter was 7.7%, excluding the $406 million non-cash charge associated with the A-12 settlement. Core operating margins increased to 9.4% in the quarter, primarily driven by favorable mix in commercial deliveries and solid productivity gains at both businesses.
Core earnings per share increased 29% to $1.88 in the quarter on higher volume and continued strong operational performance. The $0.28 benefit from the recent IRS tax regulation change for research credits partially offset the $0.34 earnings per share impact from the A-12 settlement.
Let's discuss Commercial Airplanes now on slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business increased revenue 4% to $14.7 billion on 172 airplane deliveries and increased operating margins to 10.3%. Higher volume, favorable delivery mix and strong performance was offset by the anticipated increase in fourth quarter R&D spending and higher 787 dilution.
Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $53 billion, an increase of 8% as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases, resulting in record deliveries totaling 648 aircraft. Commercial Airplanes captured $43 billion of net orders during the quarter and increased backlog to a new record of $374 billion and over 5,000 aircraft.
Gross inventory for the Company included $33.1 billion related to the 787 program. An increase in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.7 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the higher planned inventory and to support the production rate increased to 10-per-month and the introduction of the 787-9 program.
Included in the work-in-process inventory are deferred production costs. The deferred balance of the 787 program was $21.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators and unit costs as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilize the overall production system on the 787 program. Unit cost has improved approximately 20% over the past year on the 787-8 while we're introducing -9 into the production system and at the same time, increasing production rates by 40%.
Overall, the team has continued to make good progress in reducing production flow times and reducing part shortages at both Everett and Charleston facilities. These are key enablers to reducing unit costs and achieving planned production rates and deliveries. We're also seeing good initial progress on the 787-9 where we've seen 25% improvement in unit costs from the first airplane to the fourth airplane to rollout of the factory.
While we still have a lot of work ahead of us on the 787 program, we anticipate continued improvement as production stabilizes at 10-per-month rate. We also remain focused on improving program performance and successfully completing the flight test program on the 787-9 and the development of the 787-10.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue in our Defense business increased 6% to $8.9 billion and operating margins were 10.8%, driven by higher volume, delivery mix and improved performance. As a result of our continued focus on productivity and driving market-based affordability efforts, we have significantly reduced our cost structure and we're on track for additional reductions that will further enhance our productivity and strengthen our competitive position going forward.
International customers accounted for 33% of our defense revenue in the fourth quarter, and we continue to drive towards sustaining 30% Defense revenue from international markets going forward. Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft increased 9% to $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher deliveries. Strong operating margins of 10% in the quarter were due to increased volume and solid operating performance. Network and Space Systems revenue at $2.3 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by higher sales on ground-based missile defense and space launch systems.
Operating margins were 10.3% in the quarter, resulting from continued focus on execution and productivity, along with favorable delivery mix in the quarter. Global Services & Support reported fourth quarter revenue at $2.2 billion and solid operating margins of 12.8%. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $67 billion, with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Let's now turn to slide 8. Boeing capital net financing portfolio declined to $3.9 billion on normal run-off that exceeded new aircraft volume. Fourth quarter unallocated expense from core operations of $532 million was primarily driven by the $406 million charge associated with A-12 settlement and an increase in deferred compensation expense, driven by higher stock price and overall stock market performance.
Let's now turn to cash on slide 9. Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion and the strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volumes, strong operating performance, and timing of receipts and expenditures. With regard to capital deployment, we paid approximately $400 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 25.4 million shares for $2.8 billion.
Let's now to move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $15.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward. Again, our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of our business, return cash to shareholders, and execute on our balanced cash deployment strategy going forward.
Let's turn now to slide 11 and we'll discuss our outlook for 2014. Our guidance for 2014 reflects solid core operating performance and higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business while reflecting impact of the current DoD defense budget environment. Core earnings per share guidance for 2014 is set at between $7 and $7.20 per share.
We expect first quarter revenue, core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries and phasing of expenditures and advances. First quarter core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full-year earnings. On a GAAP EPS basis, first quarter is expected to be impacted by $140 million non-cash pension curtailment charge associated with the IEM contract extension. Again, this will not impact core EPS.
The financial effects of this agreement include the initial cash payment associated with the approval of the extension and the enhanced employee benefits as we transition from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan. The long-term benefits to both employees and the Company are clear as the unprecedented 10-year agreement further derisk the business and 777 MAX production, providing a stable foundation for productivity improvements and employment of our highly skilled workforce as we strive to remain competitive.
Revenue for 2014 is forecasted to increase between $87.5 billion and $90.5 billion. Our Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is expected to be $57.5 billion to $59.5 billion, reflecting approximately 10% growth as we execute on our record backlog. 2014 Commercial delivery forecast is between 715 and 725 airplanes. This includes approximately 110 deliveries from the 787 program, including 17 new customer introductions and additional flow time to support early introduction of the 787-9.
Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 10% on improved operating performance, offset by greater dilution impact on higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future business growth. Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2014 is between $30 billion and $31 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense environment, partially offset by ongoing international growth.
Operating margin guidance at our Defense business is forecasted at approximately 9.5%, reflecting continued productivity efforts, offset by impact of lower volume and delivery mix. We expect research and development spending for 2014 of approximately $3.2 billion, primarily driven by 737 MAX, initial 777X, and 787-10 development, along with continued key strategic investments in our Defense business.
Turning to cash flow. We expect operating cash flow before pension contributions to be approximately $7 billion, reflecting higher 737 and 787 deliveries and continued strong operating performance. The cash flow in 2014 also reflects favorable timing of receipts and expenditures last year, higher cash tax payments associated with the improved 787 unit cost in 2014, as well as fewer 767 deliveries as we efficiently transition to tanker production, and then finally, it includes the payment of the signing bonus to the IEM employees associated with the contract extension.
Our required pension contributions for 2014 will be minimal. While we aggressively look for additional opportunities to reduce future pension liabilities, we continue to proactively manage the funded status and anticipate a $750 million discretionary pension contribution in 2014.
Regarding our cash deployment, in December we announced the next steps in our balanced cash deployment strategy with a new $10 billion repurchase authorization, adding to the $800 million left on the prior authorization at year end. We anticipate completing the repurchase authorization over the next two to three years, and, furthermore, we increased our quarterly dividend 50% at the end of the year. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments to support future growth, remains a top priority for us.
So overall, strong 2013 results were driven by our continued focus on program execution, production rate increases, and productivity improvements. We expect this performance and focus to continue into 2014.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim for some final thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Greg.
Now 2013 was a very successful year for Boeing. We continued to convert our record backlog into deliveries through strong core operating performance that allows us to return cash to shareholders while investing wisely in our products, technologies and people to sustain our growth and competitiveness.
Our priorities going into 2014 remain clear: the profitable ramp-up in production on our Commercial Airplane programs; executing on our Commercial and Defense development programs; driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise; continuing to strengthen and position our Defense business with investments in growth areas amid further International expansion; and importantly, providing increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Now we'd be glad to take your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part question.
(Operator Instructions)
Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doug Harned,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I may have two parts in this. But on -- today, when you gave guidance for 2014, revenues, earnings, cash, they were less than we were expecting; I think others, too. Now, our assumption was that there's always some conservatism here but this appeared to be tied to lower-than-expected delivery rates.
And what I wanted to understand is on the 787, you're now at 10 a month, but you still have a large number of changing corp airplanes that should be delivered, so the 110 guidance seemed low to us.
And we're trying to understand how you expect 787 production and deliveries to evolve over this year and 2015? And then also how we should be looking at the ramp to 42 a month on the 737 and what that means for production and deliveries so that we have a good sense of where you're at in terms of these delivery rates? And also just, do you expect -- were these numbers or the delivery rates you're looking at, are those consistent with what you were hoping for, say, a few months ago?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. They were, Doug. Let me just start there. And then let me give you some color on 87 and 47.
On the 87, I think one thing to keep in mind is although we are executing at 10 a month, we're not delivering at 10 a month yet so you've got some transition there of going from seven a month on a delivery basis to 10. So you've got to factor that in.
There is a handful of changing corp airplanes that are in our guidance going forward for this year, and frankly, less than last year. So taking that into account and then some final deliveries at the end of the year as we've worked with customers on their ability to take certain amount of airplanes within certain timeframe. So this is all within our expectations. Team's executing very well, as you saw from last year's deliveries, very focused on meeting these objectives in 2014.
As you look to 2015, I think you'll -- if you just calculate on production rate, you'll certainly get closer to delivery expectations but certainly right now, we're focused on meeting our objectives for 2014 and getting these airplanes into the hands of our customer. On the 737, we're making great progress; 38 a month and stabilized at 38 a month.
You look at the operating metrics around us, operating at 38 a month, we have record low shortages. They are improving flow time on final line and making good progress as we look at production readiness getting to 42 a month. And obviously, that will come into play a little bit later this year so you won't get the full benefit of the 42 through the balance of the year. But again, that team has executed flawlessly and making rate breaks, keeping the production systems stable, at the same time, looking for opportunities to improve.
So that's how we see at least 87, and 37 deliveries going into this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doug Harned,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And can you say when that transition is on the 37? When you're expecting to be at 42 and what the implications are for deliveries this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I mean, we'll break 42 here in around second quarter on a production basis, and then the deliveries will start to flow out from there. And I think you saw on the 87, we just pushed our first airplane out at 10 a month earlier this week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doug Harned,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Okay, okay --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're making good progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Spingarn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I'd like to follow on to Doug's question, but specifically with respect to the cash flow guide given that Boeing's very much a cash flow story today, and again understanding the guide maybe somewhat conservative but the market's actually, I think, reacting to the other option which is that it's just disappointingly low.
So beyond the delivery discussion we just had, Greg, can you simplify this to frame 2014 cash flow in a longer-term context, understanding there was some acceleration in 2013, but that's just simply going to make some investors wonder if 2013 was a peak? And if it's not, can you help us figure out where peak is, when and how we get there? And perhaps within that, could you speak specifically to 787 cash flow profile over the next few years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, okay. Let me give you -- I'll give you some additional color going from 2013 to 2014 because that is important as you think about timing because we certainly had some very favorable timing late in the year that was really more expected to be in 2014.
So you kind of got to step back and look at the guide, recognize where we are in the year and then at the same time, look at 2013 performance. And as you saw from the guidance we issued, we far exceeded that. So timing is a big aspect of this from 2013 to 2014 as well as cash taxes so as we continue to make improvements on 787 unit costs, obviously, we'll pay more in cash taxes and that will continue going forward.
Now, that will also be, long term, be more than offset by us continuing to execute on the rate increases, increases we've talked about and continued focus on 787 unit by unit profitability. And that's ultimately going to continue to drive the cash flow profile over the long term.
Another moving piece, as I mentioned in my remarks, from 2013 to 2014 is 767 deliveries which, again, planned out lower production rate as we successfully transitioned from commercial onto tanker transition. So, again, well planned out. We know what we need to do there and then from there, it, really -- lower volume at BDS but those are really the big moving pieces from 2013 to 2014.
Now, to answer your question more long term and I partially addressed this earlier, but the fact is when you, again, when you step back and think about our production rates and what we need to do to execute on those rates on and, again, 787 unit by unit profitability, that's what's going to drive the cash flow profile throughout, again, over the long term.
So we feel very comfortable with that and I think as you saw by our cash deployment announcements on the repurchase and the dividend, we have the confidence in our ability to do that and return a good portion of that cash back to shareholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Spingarn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So Greg, that presents a fairly sizable bridge from 2014 to 2015 and beyond, but you feel comfortable that peak is somewhere in that future? We shouldn't be looking back at 2013?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, I would tell you, certainly think about where we are in deferred and I would put the peak more out in the 2016 going forward timeframe. And again, that's the production rate increases over that time, as we talked about on 87 in particular, and then the unit cost progression and improvement on 87.

    On the margin side within BCA, if you net out R&D and net out dilution from 87 and 47, it looks like you had a pretty good quarter sequentially. Usually you have a step down from Q3 to Q4 and period costs, I guess, at year end and that didn't happen this quarter, Greg.
So as we think about the margin profile, maybe you can talk a bit about what happened in Q4, why you didn't have that step down and why we shouldn't think that your margin could be quite a bit above what you're guiding for 2014?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. I think, Joe, certainly the performance on the core programs was the biggest driver in fourth quarter, particularly 37 and 777 so they executed very well.
To your point, very tight controls over the period expense, R&D, and other elements that supporting this -- so just good solid execution from the team on there. As you look forward into 2014, certainly, we have the dilution of the 787 as being one of the bigger contributors, at the same time, slightly higher R&D as we peak out on MAX but really start to get ramping up on -10 and 777X. And then again, slightly more forecasted on period expense as we double our production on 87, get more customers in our fleet and how we're supporting those customers initially as they take deliveries.
So those are the moving pieces. The team's very focused on driving productivity. We're continuing to make investments on streamlining. I talked about the production flow on the 87 and the 37, but we're continuing to look for further opportunities there and making more investments, frankly, over this period in things like automation and productivity tools than we have in the past. So team's very focused on executing and meeting these objectives.

    It seems like partnering for success probably played a pretty -- it's playing a pretty big role in the margin improvement. I was wondering if you could maybe confirm that and talk about what inning you think you're in of the process?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think we're pretty much in the same time frame we talked before. We're at the beginning; we're at the early stages of this. We've certainly -- you and I've talked about 37 margin, the 777 margins, particularly 37 through the transition of the NG and the MAX and that certainly has helped, but it's early on. We've got people, obviously, that have signed up and we have great partnerships in place to execute that going forward.
But we've got a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do from here. And I think, again, we have good plans in place and we're really engaging with the suppliers and really trying to figure out, how do we collectively work together to drive additional productivity and profitability? And again, I think we've got some good plans in place to go execute that. It's going to take time.

    Just to expand a little bit on that, Greg, on the 777 program margin given what's going on there with the transition, Jim, you said that you expected to sell that bridge out over the next couple years but obviously, there's, there are price considerations associated with that, non-recurring costs associated with that and then on the other side, partnering for success and productivity. You guys had a -- it seems to be the right assumptions for the 737 transition.
And in your comment -- your response to Joe's question, you imply that you're appropriately protecting for those items and you think that the 777 margin can be maintained and expanded? Or is there some risk there due to the items I mentioned?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I think the big picture here is that there are fewer, stronger customer franchises out there than the 777 franchise. And there are customers who will have invested heavily in this airplane, who are beginning to order the new airplane out in the future, and the reason is it represents incredible productivity versus almost any alternative.
And whereas we were building a bridge on the 37 in competition with an airplane that was somewhat comparable depending upon who's making the argument, with the 777, we're building a bridge with a franchise that is pretty singular in its strength. And so we do anticipate an ability, with these customers who are driving the productivity associated with it and the performance associated with it, we anticipate being able to build that bridge over the next number of years as we approach 2020 and then beyond with the new airplane.
And it's all about what the alternative would be as they're trying to build lift in the meantime. And so we're working with them on combined orders for the current 777 as well as the new one. And we anticipate at least the same kind of results that we had with the 37.
So we're working it. And we don't think the economics -- our current projections don't suggest that economic is going to change dramatically. Now, are we building a hedge with partnering for success and driving internal productivity? That's the way we live life around here, okay?
Now, the partnering for success will be hitting and some would say this is coincidental but will be hitting -- it's mid-stride right around the time that the bridge is being implemented and that's not by accident.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Howard Rubel,  Jefferies & Company - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And could you elaborate a little bit more on how you've tried to form a partnership with them when what we see is a little bit of angst over this contract extension? Maybe just to put in a little bit more, you're making a big investment by paying each member $10,000 today and so what do you expect to get tomorrow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, Howard, this is a good question. I think, again, just starting at 50,000 feet here for a second, we're exiting a period where every few years, we had a dramatic event. And we're entering a period of 10 years of stability. So that's the big picture.
Now, having said that, the vote was close. There were, there was, there were emotions on both sides of the equation. But I think eventually, everybody centered on this huge business opportunity we've got with the 777, and we came together.
Now, just as in the past every few years, we had to go through a period of rebuilding relationships, we now have an opportunity to do it for a 10-year period. And I think Ray and his team are reaching out and I would also say that the unions, the union out there is also reaching out.
I think both sides, I'm seeing signs of both sides seeing the size of this opportunity through the drama, heartfelt as it was, and emotion, there's still some emotion but I think we're now focused on the business opportunity. There's more interaction right now between IAM 751 and the management in Seattle than there's been a long time.
I think there's -- they're beginning to come together so I think there will be a period where we have to work together and where emotions will still play a role, but I'm convinced with a 10-year, for the 10-year opportunity in front of us like we've got, I think fairly quickly, we're going to come together and capitalize on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Howard Rubel,  Jefferies & Company - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, a follow-up, if I can, a little bit. Can we see either some change -- obviously, you offer a lot of new people an opportunity to enter the workforce and that will lower the average age over time and that's constructive development.
And also not spending all of the capital to move a plant somewhere else. Could you at least provide us with a little bit of indication of how that's helped the competitiveness of the Boeing Company?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. I think with the agreement that we were able to come to with the union, that became the best opportunity for the Company. You're right; it's capital avoidance versus moving the work. It's using some of the best, very best Aerospace workers in the world that don't have to go down a learning curve to get things done; a very committed set of folks around the Boeing brand and around our customers.
So this was the right answer for both economic, risk, and leadership reasons. Now having said that, the -- if we didn't come to that answer, we were prepared to move the work, notwithstanding some of the risks I mentioned, but given the agreement, I think this is the right answer for the Company and will benefit us going forward, both with our customers and economically.

Cai von Rumohr,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To get back to one of the early questions, cash flow guide for 2014 is considerably below I think where most people were so could you give us some more granularity in terms of some of the key issues? For example, 787 deferred, how much are they likely to be up? Your 787 tooling was up more than I guessed in the fourth quarter; how much is that up?
Do you have to pay the $400 million on the A-12? You mentioned the IAM; how big is the cash bonus? And then some color, if you could, on progress payments and excess advances. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, Cai. I'll take a shot at that. I don't think I captured all of it but I'll -- I'm sure you'll catch me if I don't. Deferred, there's no change in deferred and then that profile, as we've said, reaching the $25 billion and -- by late 2014, so that has not changed in, from what we talked prior.
In 2013 to 2014, some of the biggest drivers, certainly, would be in timing. And as I said we had some real favorable timing in the fourth quarter that initially we expected to be in early 2014. The cash tax, as I talked about that, but again, when you step back the cash taxes on the 787 are the result of improved performance on the 787.
So continuing to come down that learning curve and improving unit by unit, we are going to pay more in cash taxes and so there's some headwind in 2014 that wasn't in 2013. And then as I said, making the successful transition over on the tanker, we'll have fewer airplanes we'll deliver on the 767 this year from last year, so those are the big moving pieces. And then everything beyond that is more -- rather smaller than those pieces. So that's what it is; we understand it.
Team's very focused on cash management, as you've seen over the last couple of years and how we have executed on meeting our objectives and quite frankly, exceeding them a couple years in a row. So it's early; we're going to stay focused on it.
And just one other point, you mentioned A-12; that was a non-cash so there's no impact there but again, looking forward, it's all about us meeting our production rates, and coming down on that learning curve on the 787. Those are the two biggest elements as we look forward and continuing to grow cash flow going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cai von Rumohr,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you had also mentioned the investment in the 87. Your 787 tooling was up in the fourth quarter. Is that going to be up and how big was the IAM bonus and IAM pensions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I don't expect the tooling to be up. There was a one-off in there related to a suppliers meeting some key performance objectives. So I wouldn't see that growing over time. The IAM agreement was about $300 million.

Peter Arment,  Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc. - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Greg, can I just circle back quickly on the 787 delivery guidance, you mentioned there was going to be less of the change in corporate aircraft delivered this year? Is that just, is it driven by the customer timing and acceptance or are you still struggling to complete some of those early ones?
And then just related to that, if you could also address how things are going in Charleston in terms of there's been some articles written, just reducing the flow times, the part shortages you -- Jim mentioned. I think you've made some progress but you're talking about adding some people. Maybe you could just provide a little more color?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, let me maybe start there and then I'll bring you back to deliveries. But certainly, when you look at flow time, you look at unit cost at Charleston whether it's final, mid or after, it made great, great progress there.
And the team has been very focused on continuing that progress going forward. We have experienced some -- a higher number of jobs behind schedule in the mid-body section. And that's really due to, if you think about it, you're introducing the -9, at the same time, going to 10 a month. And just a reminder, most of -- the most significant structural change in the airplane going from a -8 to a -9 is in the mid-body.
So to address this, we've applied additional resources. We know how to do this. And we'll get those jobs back to what we view as a more acceptable level.
So we've got mitigation plans. They're building at 10 a month. And as you've seen, we just finished that first airplane at 10 a month, so we know what to do here. We've got the right people addressing it.
And this is, again, this is just all part of bringing this program up to a wide-body rate that, obviously, has never been done and they're doing it successfully. But there's going to be points in the production system where you're going to have to put additional resources from time to time and this just happens to be one of them.
But stepping back from there, that team is doing a great job, as is obviously the team in Everett. On the 87 deliveries for the year, yes, there's fewer EMC.
Some of that's customer; some of that is that the airplanes that are in-flow this year are longer-flow, so they have more outstanding work to be completed than some of them that had in 2013. So you kind of got to take that into consideration. And then at the same time, as I mentioned, you've got additional flow in there for -9.
Again, progressing well, but as we've got to introduce that into the production system and get the flow time being equal on the -8 to the -9, there's some transitional period there. And then of course on top of that, we're introducing 17 new customers in 2014. So there's some consideration for that through the 2014 deliveries. So those are the big moving pieces within 87 deliveries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ron Epstein,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just want to circle back on, this came up in a couple previous questions but maybe from a different point of view. When we think about a little bit of a longer-term picture and we've got the transition between the 737 NG to the 737 MAX, we've got the R&D program ahead of us on the 777X, how should we think about that and the potential impact on margins?
Do you expect a smooth transition, I guess first part of the question between the NG and the MAX; that would be interesting? And then two, it seems like despite a scope of the project, even though it's a derivative, but a new big wing on a big airplane that, that's, I don't know, $8 billion, plus or minus, a couple billion size program, right? So how should we think about those as headwinds in the future?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, Ron, I'll take a swing at that one. My view is that the next 10 years are significantly derisked when compared with the previous 10, okay?
And why do I say that? You mentioned derivative elements in the new, in the two big programs that lie in front of us. I would add the -10 to that, 787-10. Technologies harvested largely from the 787 that have now matured, Lord knows we lived through the maturational process, not as elegantly as we would have liked, but we're now in a position that we can move those technologies into our new platforms. And so it is a huge opportunity because the economics of a new 777, the -10 and the MAX are very strong; customer acceptance, as you've seen, is very strong.
And the risk that we will absorb in developing them as well as introducing them into production are -- is, I would characterize as significantly less than we've had over the last 10 years. Now that doesn't mean that these are free throws, okay?
But just more specifically on the 37, it's basically the same line. There are some changes to the structure, obviously, and certainly the engine buildup and the engine itself is different, the front strut. 777 will also use the same line; you're right.
The developing the wing is something that lies in front of us but it's our fourth-generation airfoil with the composite matrix we're going to use on that wing. So we've got some experience with it; it's bigger.
But scaling up is something, is one kind of challenge. A completely new material for any kind of an airfoil is a totally different kind of challenge, a challenge that we absorbed in the last decade. And the -10, the third derivative type program is really a stretch of the -9 with some modifications, that actually give us an opportunity to make the -8, -9, and -10 more common.
We're going to use the, which will reduce the risk, the production risk to the program overall, so whether at a 50,000-foot level or a program by program -- we're highly confident that these are programs where we can harvest the growth opportunities that our customers have told us are there with the huge number of orders we've gotten on all those planes.

    Greg, just wanted to go back in terms of some of the free cash that's just directly, it's advance of a source of cash this year and then related to that, can you talk a little bit about cash deployment? Are you still thinking 80%, 85% of that will go back to shareholders this year or given the $15 billion in cash on the balance sheet, could we see a higher number this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think you'll see a higher number this year, Sam. We're obviously, as I said, we're committed to executing on that balance deployment, the $10 billion of authorization and the dividend. So as I, I think I said before, plus or minus 80%, it's going to vary from year to year, but I expect us to be north of that in 2014 so we're committed to doing that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam Pearlstein,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then just on the R&D, can you break up a little bit, with the $3.2 billion this year? How much of that is Commercial versus Defense? Because it just looks like you're going to see the growth in the Commercial. I'm trying to think, should we assume that, that's going to continue to grow until the MAX entry into service?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg Smith,  Boeing Co - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Defense is kind of flat. It's about $1.2 billion so you are seeing a slight increase there in 2014 and again, that's the -9 coming down, 37 MAX picking up in investment and that will peak in 2015 and then again, early introduction on the 777X and the 10 X, so those are the big moving pieces in 2014.
As you look to 2015 and out and certainly, we're early in having that discussion but we're going through program by program and doing what Jim said. Where are we leveraging our prior investments in technology? Where are we applying replication?
And where -- really, where are we leveraging key technologies that we have on other programs? Real, obviously, keen focus on affordability and disciplined operating rhythm around our R&D expenditures. And I think, frankly, you saw some results of that in 2013 so we're continuing to work through the next three to five years on that profile but again, real focused on affordability there.

    Just looking back at the IAM contract debate, Boeing really talked about how airplanes were being sold for a lower -- I'm sorry, much higher relative discount than in the past.
As you look at Airbus' next move, potentially putting new engines on the A330, and you look at that as a lower-cost option for delivering the kind of efficiencies that airlines are clamoring for, as you look at it from a strategic perspective, is there any regret, from your perspective, about not continuing to invest in the 767 as a lower-cost offering to airlines with [largely existing] 767 fleets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Absolutely no regret. I think if you look at the operating performance of a, virtually any of the 87 family, compared with whatever they may do with the A330 and it's pure speculation, Jon, as far as I know. I know nothing. The operating advantage that we have is very, very compelling. Now could they build an airplane and lower the price to a point where it breaks even on some NPV analysis?
Maybe, but paying for that, the development you allude to and still having it all work would be tough in that kind of environment. So no, we're highly confident that we've gotten an answer for anything they might do with the A330 and the 767, as you know, is alive and well; selling freighters to great customers like Federal Express, and will become the basis of a 40-year-plus, as some people say. I don't know how long it will be, but some people say that the tanker program could last 40 years. That's a pretty good deployment of that capability in my mind.

    Jim, my question arises out of the recent Machinist deal, which as you know, they had to give up their defined benefit pensions. Many shop floor workers and others in Washington State are pointing to your personal defined benefit pension, which will pay out more than $3.6 million a year and asking -- where's the shared sacrifice from you and other top executives? What would you tell them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [51]

    Well, listen. I think the IAM, deal first of all, was a necessary deal that makes this Company very competitive, okay? Now, in addition, we do have a very, very large, even after that deal and some other deals that we've got, we still have a very large pension obligation that we need to address over the next few years.
And we will address it. And we're not prepared to have a discussion about that today. But the principle of dealing with that in a fair and equitable way is something that we're mindful of and -- but stay tuned.

    I wanted to ask, last summer, you were saying, in terms of the budget, US budget cuts and sequestration, that we're not out of the woods, we're going into the woods. I wonder if you could talk descriptively about how that picture has changed now that we're seeing more clarity on the 2014 horizon? And also just on the commercial side, in terms of your sense of the readiness of the suppliers to support your ramps in production?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On the Commercial side to the second part?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As to sequestration, I think what really happened with the deal, that the Ryan-Murray deal was sort of -- one way to think about it simply is that it delayed the full impact of sequestration by 18 to 24 months by about a half, okay?
And so it's -- sequestration still lurks out there. It could be dealt with legislatively again. There's time to have a rational debate about that, and in the meantime, there is relief for 18 to 24 months.
So that's the quick way to think about that. In terms of readiness and Boeing, by the way, as I think both Greg and I said in our remarks, did very well with that incremental funding in terms of program allocation.
Supplier readiness, look, it's an incredible part of the work we do to be prepared for these rate breaks. It's going well; we've gone through a series of rate uppers over the last two or three years.
We're actually entering a period now over the next two or three years where there's a more, there's a -- the rate changes aren't as dramatic. And therefore, there will be somewhat less pressure on suppliers but we're feeling very confident in their ability to deliver the program that we've described to you out in the next few years.

    Jim, I wonder if I could ask you a broad macroeconomic question, please. You have seen, for some time now, China, India, Indonesia, several emerging market economies reporting economic slowdown. And now we're seeing significant currency volatility of a currency like the Indonesian currency against the Dollar.
Are you at all concerned that this is going to have a negative impact on your Commercial Aircraft order backlog? In other words, are you alert and concerned about the risk that some airlines, as a result of lower growth currency volatility, could actually cancel orders, deferred deliveries, et cetera? How do you look at it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim McNerney,  Boeing Co - Chairman and CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We haven't seen that yet. And we have had no leading indicator discussions with people either. So I think, from time to time, we do have these currency flurries.
China, as they go through their leadership transition, there is some uncertainty and 1 point or 2 points of slowdown in the overall economy as they try to get their feet underneath them with the new leadership. I don't think the China story has changed, personally. I see the currency as a country by country. The -- and I think the big picture, and so I don't see an epidemic at this stage.
And the other thing to be mindful of is that half of the planes we sell are a very, very big value proposition to these airlines. The planes they're replacing are dramatically inefficient versus the ones that we have, whether it's the new 777 or the 787. So a 10% move in currency, even a 20% move in currency isn't going to get in the way of providing 50% -- 30%, 40% improvements in overall economics that these planes have. So we're a little bit insulated in that way, too.

    Obviously, you had a blockbuster year for orders last year. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color for what you expect for 2014 and also what your thinking is for book-to-bill. Do you see orders exceeding deliveries?

    Well, I think this year will be -- as we look at it, it feels like at least a book-to-bill of 1-to-1 coming up this year.

    You mentioned the customer by customer variation in the reliability for the 787. So I just wondered if you could say more about that. Why would there be differences from one customer to the next? And what kinds of reliability -- what are maybe the top one or two reliability issues you're still dealing with on that?

    Well, each customer has different ways of using and operating airplane. There's also some randomness about it. But 98% is, which is the average, is a pretty good number. I think about 45% of the fleet is operating above the 98.5%, which is getting closer to our 99%-plus objective.
So there's just sort of standard randomness but also some operating things, the operating differences across the airlines, but the -- there's still some software debugging that's going on. There's some electromechanical systems that have to be replaced a little more often than we want them to be replaced but all those trends are coming down. And so we remain confident that we're -- that this year, we're going to reach our goal of getting over 99% reliability.
